## Executive Summary

Harvest Point is a custom-built Point of Sale (POS) system designed specifically for the Urban Oasis Project farmers market. It's a mobile-first web application that enables volunteers to efficiently process sales, track orders, and provide real-time insights to market leadership.

Unlike generic POS solutions, Harvest Point was built with the unique needs of community farmers markets in mind—volunteer-friendly operation, offline capability, and no subscription fees.
